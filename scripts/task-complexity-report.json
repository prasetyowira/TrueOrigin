    {
      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Landing Page",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the landing page implementation into specific subtasks focusing on responsive design, content refinement, component enhancement, navigation functionality, and final testing across devices.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves refining existing components rather than building from scratch, but requires attention to responsive design across multiple device sizes and ensuring all sections match the Figma design. The task spans multiple components (header, hero, value proposition, etc.) and includes both visual and functional elements."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Public Verification Interface",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the QR code verification interface implementation into subtasks covering camera access setup, QR scanning functionality, API integration, verification result display states, error handling, and responsive design implementation.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex functionality including camera access, QR code scanning, API integration, and multiple result states. It requires careful error handling for camera permissions and invalid codes, plus mobile-first responsive design implementation."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Reward Redemption Flow",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the reward redemption flow into subtasks covering wallet input methods, wallet validation, API integration, success/failure states, and state management between verification and redemption steps.",
      "reasoning": "This task builds on the verification flow and adds wallet scanning/input functionality, API integration for redemption, and state management across multiple steps. It requires handling different input methods (QR scan or manual input) and managing the transition between verification and redemption."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Develop UI Component Library",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the UI component library development into logical component groups: modal system, button variants, form input components, feedback components, layout components, and documentation/accessibility implementation.",
      "reasoning": "This is a broad task covering multiple component types with consistent styling, accessibility requirements, and documentation. Creating a cohesive design system with proper tokens and ensuring consistency across all components adds significant complexity. The task requires both technical implementation and design system thinking."

      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Brand Owner Dashboard Layout",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the brand owner dashboard layout implementation into subtasks covering sidebar navigation, top bar/header, responsive behavior, and route configuration for nested dashboard sections.",
      "reasoning": "This task focuses on creating a layout structure with navigation components. While it requires responsive design considerations and route configuration, it's more straightforward than some other tasks since it's primarily structural and doesn't involve complex data operations."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Product Management Page",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the product management page implementation into subtasks covering filter controls, product table with pagination, API integration for product data, action functionality (edit/generate QR), and responsive design implementation.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a data-heavy interface with filtering, pagination, and multiple actions. It requires API integration for fetching product data and implementing interactive filtering functionality. The combination of data management and UI implementation increases complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Add Product Form",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the add product form implementation into subtasks covering form field components, validation logic, metadata management UI, API integration for submission, and success/error feedback implementation.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves enhancing an existing component with form validation, API integration, and dynamic metadata management. The complexity comes from implementing proper validation with react-hook-form and zod, plus handling the dynamic nature of metadata key-value pairs."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Reseller Dashboard",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the reseller dashboard implementation into subtasks covering layout structure, registration form with validation, file upload functionality, certification page, API integration, and responsive design implementation.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating multiple pages with form components, file upload handling, and API integration. The registration form has multiple field types including document uploads, which adds complexity. Creating both the dashboard layout and the registration flow makes this a substantial task."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement User Dashboard",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the user dashboard implementation into subtasks covering profile management UI, verification history list with pagination, rewards display, settings page, and API integration for user data.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires implementing multiple dashboard sections with different functionality, including profile management, verification history with pagination, and settings. It involves API integration for multiple data types and responsive design considerations."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Comprehensive Error Handling",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the error handling implementation into subtasks covering global error boundary, standardized API error handling, form validation error display, network error handling, error logging system, and consistent loading/empty states.",
      "reasoning": "This is a cross-cutting concern that affects the entire application and requires a systematic approach. It involves creating a global error boundary, standardizing error handling across all components, implementing logging, and ensuring consistent user feedback. The comprehensive nature and dependency on all other tasks makes this complex."
