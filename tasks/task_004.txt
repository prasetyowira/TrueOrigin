# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop UI Component Library
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Continue developing the reusable UI component library with consistent design tokens
# Details:
Continue developing the UI component library using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui version 2.3.0 as a foundation. Several components have already been implemented (Filters, LandingCard, ProtectedRoute, QRCodeScanner, Sidebar, Table). Additionally, initial implementation/setup for Modal, Button, Input, Checkbox, Radio Group, Toast, Select, and Alert components using shadcn/ui v2.3.0 is now complete. Documentation and initial design consistency review for existing components have also been addressed.

Focus on refining and extending these components, particularly:

1. Enhancing Modal components with additional variations and use cases
2. Expanding Button components with application-specific variants
3. Extending Input components with custom validation patterns
4. Refining form components (selects, checkboxes, radio buttons) for specific use cases
5. Enhancing feedback components (toasts, alerts) with application-specific messaging
6. Additional layout and navigation components as needed

Maintain consistent styling with Tailwind CSS across all components. Continue to refine the cohesive design system with tokens for colors, typography, spacing, and shadows. Ensure all components are accessible and responsive, and continue to document new features and variations.

# Test Strategy:
Test each component individually for proper rendering and functionality. Verify components work correctly across different screen sizes. Check accessibility compliance for all interactive components. Ensure consistent styling and behavior across the component library. For already implemented components (Filters, LandingCard, ProtectedRoute, QRCodeScanner, Sidebar, Table, Modal, Button, Input, Checkbox, Radio Group, Toast, Select, Alert), perform regression testing to ensure they continue to function correctly with new additions and refinements.
