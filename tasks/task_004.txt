# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop UI Component Library
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Continue developing the reusable UI component library with consistent design tokens
# Details:
Continue developing the UI component library using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui version 2.3.0 as a foundation. Several components have already been implemented (Filters, LandingCard, ProtectedRoute, QRCodeScanner, Sidebar, Table). Focus on creating additional reusable components identified in the PRD/designs, particularly:

1. Modal components with standard variations (using shadcn/ui Dialog component as base)
2. Button components with different states and variants (using shadcn/ui Button component as base)
3. Input components with validation states (using shadcn/ui Input component as base)
4. Remaining form components (selects, checkboxes, radio buttons)
5. Feedback components (toasts, alerts)
6. Additional layout and navigation components as needed

Maintain consistent styling with Tailwind CSS across all components. Implement a cohesive design system with tokens for colors, typography, spacing, and shadows. Document each component with usage examples and props. Ensure all components are accessible and responsive.

# Test Strategy:
Test each component individually for proper rendering and functionality. Verify components work correctly across different screen sizes. Check accessibility compliance for all interactive components. Ensure consistent styling and behavior across the component library. For already implemented components (Filters, LandingCard, ProtectedRoute, QRCodeScanner, Sidebar, Table), perform regression testing to ensure they continue to function correctly with new additions.

# Subtasks:
## 4.1. Implement Modal Component [pending]
### Dependencies: None

### Details:


## 4.2. Implement Button Component System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive Button component with variants (primary, secondary, tertiary), states (default, hover, active, disabled), and sizes (small, medium, large). Use shadcn/ui Button component as the foundation.
### Details:

### Details:


## 4.4. Document Existing Components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create documentation for already implemented components (Filters, LandingCard, ProtectedRoute, QRCodeScanner, Sidebar, Table) with usage examples and props. Ensure documentation specifically covers how these components integrate with shadcn/ui version 2.3.0 and any version-specific features being utilized.
### Details:


## 4.5. Ensure Design Consistency [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review all components to ensure consistent application of design tokens and Tailwind classes. Verify that all components follow shadcn/ui version 2.3.0 conventions and best practices for styling and component structure.
### Details:


## 4.6. Verify shadcn/ui Version Compatibility [pending]
### Dependencies: None
