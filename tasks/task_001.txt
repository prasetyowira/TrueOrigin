# Task ID: 1
# Title: Implement Landing Page
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Refine the landing page content, ensure responsiveness, and add any missing sections based on the Figma design
# Details:
The basic landing page structure (home.tsx, LandingCard.tsx) has already been implemented. Now focus on refining the content, ensuring responsive behavior across all device sizes, and adding any missing sections from the Figma design in `plans/design.md`. Review and enhance the existing reusable components for the header, hero section, value proposition, key stakeholders section, technology section, and footer. Continue using Tailwind CSS for styling adjustments. Verify that all navigation links to the verification page, login page, and dashboard areas are working properly. Ensure the 'Book Demo' button and other call-to-action elements are fully functional and visually aligned with the design.

# Test Strategy:
Manually test the landing page on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) to ensure responsive design. Verify all navigation links work correctly. Check that all images and assets are properly loaded and displayed. Compare the implemented page against the Figma design to ensure all sections are included and styled correctly.
