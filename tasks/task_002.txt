# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Public Verification Interface
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the QR code scanning and verification result display for product authentication
# Details:
Implement the QR scanner page (`ScanPage.tsx`) with camera access using the HTML5 QR code library. Create verification result modals/pages (`VerificationResultModal.tsx`) to display success, failure, or already scanned states. Integrate with the `verify_product_v2` API to validate scanned QR codes. Display product information on successful verification. Follow the mobile-first design from Figma (iPhone 13 layout) and ensure proper error handling for camera permissions and invalid codes. Use shadcn/ui version 2.3.0 for UI components throughout the implementation.

# Test Strategy:
Test QR code scanning with various QR codes (valid first scan, valid subsequent scan, invalid). Verify camera permissions work correctly. Test error handling for network issues and invalid codes. Ensure the UI matches the Figma design and is responsive on mobile devices. Verify that shadcn/ui components are properly implemented and styled according to the design system.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement QR Scanner Page with Camera Access [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the ScanPage.tsx component with HTML5 QR code library integration for camera access and QR code scanning functionality
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create ScanPage.tsx component with responsive layout following the iPhone 13 design from Figma
2. Integrate the HTML5 QR code library to access device camera
3. Implement camera permission request and handling
4. Add error states for camera access denial or unavailability
5. Create scanning overlay UI with guidance for users using shadcn/ui 2.3.0 components
6. Implement QR code detection callback that passes scanned data to verification function
7. Add loading state while verification is in progress
8. Test with various devices to ensure camera works correctly
9. Implement proper cleanup of camera resources when component unmounts

## 2. Create Verification Result Modal with Product Information Display [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Develop VerificationResultModal.tsx to show verification outcomes (success/failure/already scanned) with appropriate product information using StatusBadge and ProductInfo components
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create VerificationResultModal.tsx component with three states: success, failure, and already scanned
2. Implement StatusBadge component to visually indicate verification status using shadcn/ui 2.3.0 components
3. Create ProductInfo component to display product details (name, brand, manufacturing date, etc.) using shadcn/ui 2.3.0 components
4. Style the modal according to Figma designs with mobile-first approach
5. Use shadcn/ui Dialog or Sheet component for the modal implementation
6. Add animations for modal appearance/disappearance
7. Ensure modal is accessible and can be dismissed
8. Display appropriate messaging for each verification state
9. For successful verifications, show complete product information
10. For failures or already scanned products, show appropriate error messaging
11. Test the modal with various product data structures to ensure proper rendering

<info added on 2025-04-30T05:21:47.611Z>
For the VerificationResultModal implementation, use shadcn/ui 2.3.0's Dialog component as the primary modal container. Specifically:

- Import Dialog, DialogContent, DialogHeader, and DialogTitle from "@/components/ui/dialog" (shadcn/ui 2.3.0)
- For mobile responsiveness, consider using the Sheet component variant which is optimized for mobile displays
- Leverage shadcn/ui's Alert and AlertDescription components for status messaging
- Use the Badge component from shadcn/ui for the StatusBadge implementation with appropriate variant props (default, destructive, outline) to indicate different verification states
- Implement motion animations using the built-in shadcn animation properties or integrate with framer-motion for custom transitions
- Ensure proper ARIA attributes are set through the shadcn Dialog props for accessibility compliance

## 3. Integrate Verification API with Robust Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Connect the QR scanner to the verify_product_v2 API endpoint with comprehensive error handling and state management
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Update productApi.ts to include the verify_product_v2 endpoint integration
2. Implement proper error handling for API calls (network errors, timeouts, server errors)
3. Create verification state management to track scanning and verification process
4. Handle edge cases like invalid QR codes, expired products, or tampered codes
5. Implement retry logic for failed API calls
6. Add detailed error logging for debugging purposes
7. Create user-friendly error messages for different failure scenarios using shadcn/ui 2.3.0 Alert and Toast components
8. Implement offline detection and appropriate messaging
9. Add analytics tracking for verification attempts and results
10. Test the complete verification flow with various test QR codes (valid, invalid, already scanned)
11. Ensure proper state transitions between scanning, loading, and result display

## 4. Set up shadcn/ui 2.3.0 Components and Theme [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install and configure shadcn/ui version 2.3.0 for use in the verification interface
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Install shadcn/ui version 2.3.0 and its dependencies
2. Configure the theme to match the Figma design system
3. Set up the necessary component registry
4. Create a component library documentation for the team
5. Ensure proper integration with the existing styling system
6. Test component accessibility and responsiveness
7. Create reusable component compositions for common UI patterns in the verification flow
8. Document any custom extensions or modifications to the base shadcn/ui components
